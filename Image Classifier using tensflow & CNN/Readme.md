Convolution neural network also know as shift invariant artificial neural network is used in image recognition. It is unsupervised learning. The main idea behind image recognition is that a large input image is broken down to small overlapping tile images. These images are fed to multiple convolution layers where each convolution layer tries to identify unique features of the image. The more convolution steps we have the more complicated features will our network be able to recognize. We add max pooling layer after each convolutional layer to reduce the image size.  
 
With very small dataset and after multiple iterations, I was able to achieve 88% accuracy.
